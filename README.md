This script provides a snapshot of my knowledge of more advanced programming practices in C#, namely the StreamReader and StreamWriter classes, regular expressions, and try-catch blocks. It allows the user to enter a local path of a .txt document and regular expression, returning the indices of the first letters of any matches found in the document at the path and the lines on which the matches were found.
